I'm a rising junior attending Medgar Evers College and am pursuing a Bachelor's
degree of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
I was initially pursuing a degree in Biology, however after a colleague
gave me a tour of his role as a junior startup developer, I took an interest
in programming.
