      <p class="description">
        I'm an alumnus of Medgar Evers College and graduated cum laude
        with a Bachelor's degree of Science in Computer Science.
        <br>
        I work mostly in Python developing APIs in the open source
        software space.
        <br>
        I'm currently working in freelance while simultaneously creating and
        maintaining hobby projects.

      <p class="description">
        Outside of programming, I thoroughly enjoy a good game/puzzle.
        <br>
        My main hobby is restoring and upgrading retro tech (think: old game systems
        and laptops).
        <br>
        I love science fiction, mostly books, but I find any related media
        entertaining.

          <h4 class="font"> Atawear </h4>
        </a>
        <p class="description">
          Atawear was a proof-of-concept IoT project in which I worked in a team
          of five to develop a bracelet for infants that detected changes in
          heart rate/rhythm.
          <br>
          The project consisted of two main components:
          <br>
          A Raspberry Pi Zero-W attached with a heart rate sensor and
          portable battery.
          <br>
          A web app powered by Python that transformed and displayed heart rate data.
          <br>
          The main goal of the device was to detect for episodes of heart
          fibrillation (a phenomenon where the heart beats in inconsistent
          intervals).
          <br>
          Communication between the device and web application, as well as the
          application itself, was written entirely in python using the Python
          Dash framework.

          <h4 class="font"> The  Daily Popcorn </h4>
        </a>
        <p class="description">
          Daily Popcorn was a MVP web application in which I worked in a team
          of three to create an application that was a cross between rotten
          tomatoes and yelp.
          <br>
          Daily Popcorn was implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS,
          ReactJS, and NodeJS).
          <br>
          I mainly worked on the back end portion of the application, using
          Javascript to retrieve and cache JSON data from an imdb api endpoint.
          Caching was done by saving api requests to a database using PostgresSQL.
