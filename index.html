  <!-- Atawear was a proof-of-concept IoT project in which I worked in a team
  of five to develop a bracelet for infants that detected changes in
  heart rate/rhythm.
  The project consisted of two main components:
  A Raspberry Pi Zero-W attached with a heart rate sensor and
  portable battery.
  A web app powered by Python that transformed and displayed heart rate data.
  The main goal of the device was to detect for episodes of heart
  fibrillation (a phenomenon where the heart beats in inconsistent
  intervals).
  Communication between the device and web application, as well as the
  application itself, was written entirely in python using the Python
  Dash framework.

  Daily Popcorn was a MVP web application in which I worked in a team
  of three to create an application that was a cross between rotten
  tomatoes and yelp.
  Daily Popcorn was implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS,
  ReactJS, and NodeJS).
  I mainly worked on the back end portion of the application, using
  Javascript to retrieve and cache JSON data from an imdb api endpoint.
  Caching was done by saving api requests to a database using PostgresSQL. -->
