      <p class="description">
        I'm a rising junior attending Medgar Evers College and am pursuing a
        Bachelor's degree of Science in Computer Science with a minor in
        Mathematics.<br>
        I work mostly in Python developing web applications and open source
        software.<br>
        After interning at Google I intend to pursue a career in software
        engineering.

      <p class="description">
        Outside of programming, I thoroughly enjoy puzzles, board games,
        and video games.<br>
        I'm a fan of games in general, more specifically games that require
        strategy and careful thought.<br>
        I love science fiction, mostly books, but I find any related media
        entertaining.

          <h4 class="font"> Atawear </h4>
        </a>
        <p class="description">
          Atawear was a proof-of-concept IoT project in which I worked in a team
          of five to develop a bracelet for infants that detected changes in
          heart rate/rhythm.
          <br>
          The project consisted of two main components:
          <br>
          A Raspberry Pi Zero-W attached with a heart rate sensor and
          portable battery.
          <br>
          A web application that transformed and displayed heart rate data.
          <br>
          The main goal of the device was to detect for episodes of heart
          fibrillation (a phenomenon where the heart beats in inconsistent
          intervals).
          <br>
          Communication between the device and web application, as well as the
          application itself, was written entirely in python using the Python
          Dash framework.

          <h4 class="font"> Anonymous Health </h4>
        </a>
        <p class="description">
          AnonymousHealth was a MVP web application in which I worked in a team
          of three to create a forum-like application where users can
          anonymously seek advice or discuss mental health issues.
          <br>
          Powered by Google AppEngine, the application was implemented using
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
          <br>
          I mainly worked on the back end portion of the application, using
          Python to implement a swear filter, store comments to the cloud
          (AppEngine), and properly load Jinja templates.
